            <p> As a student of the <strong>TU Delft</strong> I participated in an interdisiplinary project in collaboration with <i>Royal
                Delft</i> to create Delft Blue painted using a Universal Robots UR5 robot. Aside from this we also
                modified a 3D printer to prototype with parallel to the robot. The aim of this project was to
                innovate the traditional Delft Blue to prevent it from going out of style. The duration of this
                project was 10 weeks at full time participation
                In this project my main function was the illustrative design for the tiles using Adobe Illustrator,
                making artistic choices as well as general project organisation and management. </p>
